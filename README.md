# üß† Basic Kubernetes MCP Server

This is a lightweight MCP (Model Control Protocol) Server that interacts with your local Kubernetes cluster.  
It doesn't run *inside* the cluster ‚Äî instead, it runs locally and uses your kubeconfig to communicate with the cluster.

### UPDATE: Will try to run the MCP Server inside the K8's cluster itself, Please Ignore the INFRA directory for now
